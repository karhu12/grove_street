                        I am an experienced software developer with a strong background in frontend and
                        backend development using Python. I have developed and designed user interfaces
                        using PyQt and QML, implemented business logic and other backend logic,
                        integrated measuring instruments and other devices with the software that was
                        being developed. I have worked in tight collaboration with clients where I have
                        been a part of setting up measurement systems, solving problems and giving
                        software training for the said systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am an able programmer who can adapt quickly to new technologies. I am most
                        confident in my skills with the Python programming language, as I have 5 years
                        of work experience from it in my previous position. I have also used JavaScript
                        with QML and C with embedded systems in my work. In terms of advancing my
                        professional skills, I am keen to learn more about new technologies that
                        I donâ€™t have experience with prior.

                    <p>
                        I am a motivated and extremely enthusiastic team player that is easy to approach with
                        any matter. I am a rigorous worker and I always fully focus on the task at hand to
                        achieve the best result. However, I am also a relaxed and cheerful person. I have
                        worked both at the office and remotely, and I view hybrid work in a positive light.
                        I have excellent written and spoken English language skills, and I use both Finnish
                        and English as working languages.

                        I have graduated as a bachelor of engineering from Oulu University of Applied
                        Sciences with a specialization in software development. During my education I
                        got to know basics from different software development branches, such as windows
                        application development (C++, Qt), embedded software development
                        (C, C++, Python, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Nucleo), web development
                        (PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular) databases (MySQL, NoSQL), backend development
                        (Express REST APIs) and mobile development (Java, Android, Swift, iOS).

                    <p>
                        In my work I have used common project management tools such as Jira, and I am a well
                        versed user of Git. I also have some work experience with DevOps from using GitLab
                        CI/CD and Jenkins.
